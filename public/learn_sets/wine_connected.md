title: What's wine
Facts:
Most wine is made with grapes, but they're not like the ones you find in the grocery store. Wine grapes (latin name: Vitis vinifera) are smaller, sweeter, have thick skins, and contain seeds. There are over 1,300 wine grape varieties used in commercial production but only about 100 of these varieties make up 75% of the world's vineyards.

title: Cabernet Sauvignon
Facts:
The Cabernet Sauvignon grape varietal is a cross between Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc sometime during the 1600s.  After the birth of the grape, the Cabernet Sauvignon varietal began to be adopted in parts of France by winemakers searching for more durable plants that were relatively easy to grow, and the grape found its champion in the region of Bordeaux.

title:  Red, White, Rose, Sparkling or Dessert.
facts: All wines can be organized into five basic groups. Within each group there are hundreds of different grape varieties and winemaking techniques!
Red wine is made with black grapes.
White wine is produced from white and occasionally black grapes. 
Rosé wine is produced from black grapes by removing the skins before they stain the wine deep red. 
Sparkling wine is a style of winemaking involving a secondary fermentation that makes bubbles!
Dessert wine is produced by stopping the fermentation before the yeast converts all grape sugars into alcohol.

What do I drink Cabernet Sauvignon with?

## Dot D4
The success of Bordeaux can be boiled down to one simple trait: its location. 
Bordeaux does not only possess an ideal climate and soil for growing grapes, but, due to the fact that it’s served as a major port city for centuries, it also gave the local winemakers the opportunity to access different regions of the world via its visitors. Unlike Burgundy, another famous wine region that is completely landlocked, Bordeaux was able to capitalize on the ships and wealthy merchants that filled its port daily, always sending them off with wine.

Cabernet Sauvignon is a fairly bold wine that could easily overpower more delicate flavors. While it’s traditionally paired with red meat, that shouldn’t limit you. Anything with a strong, earthy flavor (garlic, rosemary, mint) will pair well with this wine: think portabello mushrooms, olives, strong cheeses, or even strong umami flavors like miso.

Wine's flavor can vary from a year to another - why?

## Dot d6
Learning to identify wine characteristics helps to identify what you like about a wine. There are 5 of them: Sweetness (How sweet or dry (not sweet) is the wine), Acidity (How tart/zesty is the wine?, Tanning (How astringent or bitter is the wine?), Alcohol (How much does the wine warm your throat?) and Body (Body is a snapshot of the overall impression of a wine). 

## Dot d7
This is called vintage variation and it affects certain wines and growing regions more than others. 
Vintage variation is simply the difference in how a wine tastes from year to year based on the weather’s influence on the grapes during a growing season. Wine regions throughout the world with higher variable climates tend to have more extreme vintage variation. Poorly timed bad weather can have a devastating effect on the wine for that year.
