title: Abrahamic religion
facts:
group of Semitic-originated religious communities of faith. Descending from worship of Abraham (judaism) who is a major biblical figure of the the old testament. Recognized also by Jews, Christians and others.
The Abrahamic God in this sense is the conception of God that remains a common attribute of all three traditions. God is conceived of as eternal, omnipotent, omniscient and as the creator of the universe. God is further held to have the properties of holiness, justice, omni-benevolence and omnipresence. Proponents of Abrahamic faiths believe that God is also transcendent, meaning that he is outside space and outside time and therefore not subject to anything within his creation, but at the same time a personal God, involved, listening to prayer and reacting to the actions of his creatures.
